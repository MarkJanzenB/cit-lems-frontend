## Project Description

The Laboratory Equipment Monitoring System is a web-based application designed to streamline laboratory management tasks, focusing on scheduling, borrowing, breakage logging, and inventory management. The system operates independently and does not require integration with institutional systems for authentication. However, it does interface with external entities such as the universityâ€™s property custodian to provide important inventory updates.
